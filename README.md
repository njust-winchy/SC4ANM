# SC4ANM: Identifying Optimal Section Combinations for Automated Novelty Measurement in Academic Papers  


## Overview
<b>SC4ANM: Identifying Optimal Section Combinations for Automated Novelty Measurement in Academic Papers".</b>
The main contributions of this paper are reflected in the following three aspects.

-Firstly, we used the novelty scores from peer reviews as a benchmark to fine-tune current popular pre-trained language models (PLMs) designed for long texts to predict novelty scores. We also validated the effectiveness of using different section structures as input.

-Secondly, we conducted a small-scale test on novelty score prediction using prompt-based methods on LLMs. Furthermore, we analyzed the performance of the LLMs in this task under different chapter combinations, as well as the consistency between generated novelty scores and grounded scores.

-Thirdly, the results indicate that fine-tuned PLMs outperform LLMs in predicting novelty scores, though their performance is not yet satisfactory. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the introduction, results, and discussion sections are more beneficial for automatic novelty score prediction tasks.
